# Missile-Airburst-Softlaunch
Titanfall 2 mod: implements a scrapped salvo core missile mechanic, line of code still in the game files

This Mod aims to add visual airburst/softlaunch effects for most missiles
Following missiles are affected:
| Following Entity               | Effect Type                  |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Tone Salvo Core                | Softlaunch                   |
| Tone Tracker Missiles          | Airburst after set distance  |
| Monarch MTMS (guided Missiles) | Airburst after set distance  |
| Archer                         | Softlaunch                   |  

Btw, all of those have a small explosion like soft effect during the effect, you can disable it if you want by adding "//" infront of ""ignition_sound"", it should look like this "//"ignition_sound"". 

You can also customize softlaunch/airburst distance value, the distance at which the missile will perform said effect ""ignition_distance"                             "500""

It's recommended to run high particle quality settings, might cause too much flare with lower quality.
